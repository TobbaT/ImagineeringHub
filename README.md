# Imagineering Hub: an Open Fiction Sandbox

This is primarily a place to share and develop my experiments in stroytelling (usually heavily AI-assisted), but anyone is welcome to enjoy, contribute or leave feedback!

## How it works:

```
├── _layouts
│   ├── default.html
│   └── story.html
├── stories
│   └── story-1
│       ├── dev
│       │   ├── characters.md
│       │   └── README.md
│       └── public
│           ├── index.md
│           ├── chapter-1.md
│           ├── chapter-2.md
│           └── chapter-3.md
├── assets
│   └── js
│       └── scripts.js
├── _config.yml
├── index.md  # Introduction to the project/table of contents
└── README.md # This file
```

Each story has it's subfolder, with a development folder and a publication folder, both accessible in GithubPages.

In order to be visible on the index, each story needs an index.md with a story_title and a summary.

You can read the story as published and/or the develompent files which typically contain extra ideas and more info on the world.
The development folder contains a readme, explaining how the story works from a technical standpoint, any css/js it needs, why, and how to use it.
