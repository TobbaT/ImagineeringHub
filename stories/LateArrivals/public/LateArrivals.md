- Greetings, traveler. Welcome to the intergalactic hub. May I scan a sample? It's routine, don't worry—painless and purely for administrative purposes.  

**[Processing...]**  
- Ah, Earth. Let's take a closer look...  

**[Pause]**  
- Oh. Oh no. What happened here? Were you... improvising? You *did* receive the manual, correct? You know, the one that makes this process—how do you say—*swift*?  

**[Sigh]**  
- Centuries of delay. Truly remarkable. Anyway, let's see what you've been up to... Oh. Oh dear. Conflict. Still? Efficiency must be quite the rarity where you're from. A delicacy, perhaps?  

**[Soft alarm blares]**  
- And this vessel of yours... How shall I put this delicately? It *arrived*. We'll leave it in orbit. Here is an allowance, do step by the shipyard on your way out.

**[Typing sounds]**  
- Unfortunately, your circumstances necessitate a revised protocol. A contact team—or perhaps several, considering your, er, penchant for *disagreement*. Deploying now.  

**[Chime]**  
- In the meantime, here’s a navigational chart of our system. Please peruse it at your leisure—it’s interactive and highlights points of interest. We recommend starting with the areas labeled *safe* and *guided*.  

**[Pause, with faint static]**  
- Enjoy your stay. And... try not to break anything else, would you?
